## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sally 👋

I design scalable data systems and analytical workflows to solve complex, multi-dimensional problems.

With 8+ years of experience spanning computational genomics, data science, and bioinformatics engineering, I specialise in building reproducible pipelines, integrating multi-dimensional datasets, and translating complex analyses into actionable insights.

My work sits at the intersection of data, systems, and strategy — with applications across research, technology, and industry-driven innovation.
